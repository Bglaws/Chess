# Terminal chess program written in Java
This is a terminal chess game I made to better understand object oriented programming.



# Notable features

This is a fully functional chess program with only a few features ommited.
Firstly, instead of having the option to promote pawns to any piece, pawns auto-promote to a queen.
Secondly, en passant has not yet been integrated.
Thirdly, I ommited a few of the less common stalemate rules including, threefold repetiton, fifty-move rule.
